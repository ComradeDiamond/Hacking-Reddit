You woke up from a deep sleep.
You don't remember anything much that happened.
All you recall was a flashbang of light.
Ironically now, you're tied to a chair.
In the dark.
Near the candlelight, you can make out a face.
You can make out a some carvings on a gold badge

"Well hello there.
Welcome to Washington D.C. The place where all the federal hustle and marvels go on.
But we're not hear to look at that. Oh no.
You sir, have been convicted of illegal activities on the Dark Web.
Buying data archives, Cleansing Foams, forbidden drugs, heck, even weapons.
Do those stuff found familiar?
Right.
I suggest you use your right to remain silent.
Your career is official over.
The only thing you can do for yourself now...
is to prove that you have not used these items for malicious activities.
Ironically, we're the only ones that can help you now.
Tell us everything you know.
About the owner of the site.
About the bitcoins.
About the items sold.
About your sellers.
...
Not feeling talkative, eh?
Alright, you shot your shot.
Don't worry about whatever you were intending on doing.
You're going to be with us for a long. time.
Enjoy maximum security."
