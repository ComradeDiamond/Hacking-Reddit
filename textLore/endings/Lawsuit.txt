"Respondent. 
It has come to our ATTENTION that you have multiple unaddressed legal orders.
You have failed to address them or appear in them during requested court dates.
I'd like to remind you this is a SERRIOUS violation of US Civil law.
You are to IMMEDIATELY cease all activities on Srs Bot.
You are to appear in court at exactly 12:00 PM this Saturday.
There, we will determine how much you need to pay.
Failure to do so will result in possible laughter on live television.
Until then."
- Judge Judy
