"Hello there Comrade.
We have been bombarded lately with angry sentiments.
There has been multiple affairs involving Cheems#2333 and Snowbaru#1210.
General has been flooded with spam and nsfw posts.
We've also been raided online. Members of our server have been doxxed.
There has been egrigious chat violations.
We've also come to the attention of several real world authorities.
We have tried to assemble and marshall resources to get you to do your damn job.
Under investigation of Spartaan, your derilection of duty and failure to enact Discord martial law has threatened server integrity.
We conclude that you have not fulfilled any of your staff responsibilities as of late.
Your staff perms have been revoked accordingly.
There is no need to test Srs Bot anymore.
You can't use the discord API without your perms.
On the behalf of BTHS Discord Staff team,
You are dismissed of your duties.
Good Night."
- Seal Team 6, BTHS Discord Chief
