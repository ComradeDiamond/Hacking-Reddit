It's a 2020 Christmas! Discord's popping this time around!
That means you, sir Discord Mod, have a lot to add to your bot.
After 2 months of discord expecting an update to the light mode defender, you need to deliver...
something.
One thing you've procrasinated for 6 weeks now was the promise to fetch Christmas posts off Reddit.
But there's one problem.
Because reddit has been brainwashed by dumb LAS kids, you now need to sign a legal API contract.
Annndddd you're not 18. Your application is guarenteed to be denied.
It's 12/21 today. Winter Solstace.
You've got 4 days to whip up something.
Or ... let's just say... Brooklyn Snowical won't be feeling very jolly.
And you'll probably disappoint one or two lemons.
***Tutorial***
Click enter to proceed to the next line. Hey, you probably figured this out already!
Type stuff inside the lines to execute a command.
If you get really lost, try the *HelpMe* and *mkdir* command.
Everything revolves around *programs*. Programs are life.
You might want to have some programs open in the background so things don't get messy.
You also might want to *Check* your stats. It's not fun to run out of batteries.
Oh, everything you do will consume batteries. Yikes.
Might also want to use that *Help <insert JustinWare>* command often. You might find something special.
And that's the amount of help we're legally obligated to provide you. Good luck.
