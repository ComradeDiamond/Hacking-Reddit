Literally unusable ðŸ¤®
This absolute garbage of an IDE will give you headaches trying to close brackets and add semicolons.
It doesn't even have color ðŸ¤®
Thing looks like it was built back in the 1980s with that ugly interface smh
ðŸ¤® And worst of all, you'll actually need to use certain items just so you can code in this thing

Did I also mention it will throw compile errors every 5 seconds?
Wait, did I tell you it throws compile errors every 5 seconds?
