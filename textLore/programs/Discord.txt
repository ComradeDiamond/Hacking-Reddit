The official gamer hub, home of Justin's workshop and the BTHS Server.
Also the place where you test Srs Bot Code before releasing it.
Settle some lawsuits, cease and desist orders, and angry srs bot users here as well.

Just make sure you're not too inactive - or else the BTHS discord would start rioting.
While you're at it, invoke some higher powers and worship a few cats.
