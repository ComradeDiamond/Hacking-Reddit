It's a fancy IKEA table with fancy designs!
This one is specially designed for you to place a bottle of water on.
For a cheap price of $19,999.99, you can stylish-ly put some Poland Spring on the table until later.

Not intended for glasses of water. 
For that item, please buy a transparent pexiglass crystal display, now at $100,000 and 0.1% off!
For cups of water, we reccomend a $5 million 24k gold pedestal fit for the queen of England.
