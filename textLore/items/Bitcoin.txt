Bitcoin is a weird industry.
The money doesn't exist and it's basically 1s and 0s. 
This means noone can actually verify the bitcoin is yours.
Welp somehow, people are still investing in this industry. And... it's blooming. Alot.
I mean to be fair, the US currency is just a piece of paper.

So maybe a few electrons are worth more?
