Historically, the Youtube Algorithm is feared and repsected by many content creators alike.
From 5 minute crafts to Dream, the sorting and featuring algorithm has the power to give rise to powerful channels.
The twitch, twitter, and Facebook algorithms further expand this power.

But noone has effectively weaponized this system as much as a pig named Technoblade.
Following the l'manburg war, Technoblade acquired what he dubs as "the most powerful item in Dream SMP"
PigStep, a simple music disc, allows its owner to copystrike any piece of content.
It also gives its user the complete power to demonetize Twitch Streams.

Its influence also indirectly makes a designated item violate intellectual property laws.
Which *cough* unfortunately *cough* means we'll need to remove it from your inventory.
