Yikes I accidentally did a weird thing with git client and now I lose all my history progress :( :cri:
But that's okay I'll just write planning.txt again

AWS
Data Archive
Discord
Grubhub
JGrasp
Minecraft
Reddit
silk Road
Stack Overflow
 
Discord --> They'll all extend stuff
- Bot cmd and testing place
- After you successfully did something on discord, you will get a confirmation log
- Upload on discord to test a bot thing (or we'll create a different cmd)
- Cat emote triggers cat who gives you rainbow table
- Get stuff from people by spectating comments

Reddit
- The reddit land of all things reddit
- Ability to reddit comment
- Ability to send a reddit post if you like karma #dank
- Upload command is mostly useless unless you upload in certain subs
- Fake rainbow table gives access to silk road

Grubhub
- Order food for $
Literally that's it.
- Also you'll need a MLP rainbow dash thingy

Jgrasp
- Coding IDE
- Do stuff here to code
- Will have a 5000% chance of throwing errors
- When you finish something on jgrasp, you'll be able to test something on discord yay?
- You'll also be able to progress on a new item by turning in ticket

Stack Overflow
- Play a minigame to defeat recaptcha
- Fail to defeat recaptcha and you'll lose 20 batteries and 50 energy because you're a darn robot
- Has a 50% chance to get help with your jgrasp code
- If jgrasp has no bug, you'll be downvoted to oblivion unless certain quest stuff exist. Also you'll be forced to solve 3 recaptchas in a row

- 

Imo part of the fun here is just managing energy lmaooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

Minecraft
- Watch a cow go from left to right
- Occasionally a villager will trade with you for $. Still have no idea how that works.

Silk Road
- Buying stuff here has sus
- Bitcoin mitigates sus
- But it's still sus and can attract lawsuits
- Can't get rid of sus, but you can get rid of risk slowly :/

Notable items
Observe will bring up a random thing
- Cleansing foam
- BTHS Data Archive
- Riot Shield
- IKEA Table --> Use with MLP Rainbow --> Craft in Minecraft --> Rainbow Table
- AI (Weapons of math destruction lul)
- Sunglasses Drip (It's a new 2020 trend)

Drip in dark web will show you a few extra things you can buy (if have time). If not, drip will just return your risk. You're not going to know your sus stat

BTHS Data archive
- Observe: Gives random useless facts about BTHS
- Slap a pair of sunglasses and then you'll know how to get hackersend ending

Get rainbow table items --> Get rainbow table
Use rainbow table in jgrasp
Folwell Password cracking powerpoint --> if you view Folwell decryption lessons --> Password Cracker
Use password cracker in jgrasp and....
Try to brute force your way in jgrasp (Run time error - computer crashes)  --> If you use glasses on jgrasp tho, you'll know to go on folwell office hours and he'll do it for you
Get the reddit private encryption key --> Use it in reddit
Get access to reddit panel. 
Change the reddit API TOS. You'll need a password but the data archive should tell you it's smth like "Arrays are trash"
Apply for a reddit API --> Get reddit API key ("I believe in ArrayList Supremacy")
Use API Key
Srs Bot and win

Alternatively, you could go to normal route...
Reddit your way to r/christmas
Have jgrasp on
Have heroku on
Upload on stack overflow and they'll give you developer tools

Use devtools on reddit. This will give you a tad bit of risk.
Play with a ton of games. You'll uncover something.
You can also unscramble some text to report smth. Or you can just type quit. If you get it wrong you get risk.

1) HTML div classNames are all _____________
2) Literally just write something about img and you'll find they have a link
3) Literally write smth about r/christmas

Input all 3 successfully in jgrasp and then run bot and you'll find web fetching module does not exist when git upload. BUT you'll now get an error log. Jgrasp will show a "jgrasp error"
Use the error log on stack overflow and everyone will get mad at you and you'll get a lawsuit
Lawsuit should prompt you to use it in discord, where you can say waste energy until cat responds. That's a 20% chance.
cat will then tell you to use jsdom library
Use library in jgrasp. Debug. Run discord. Upload github.
Now you get another huge bug about new reddit restricting bot access. Stack Overflow will ask you to use old reddit and give old reddit link.
Use old reddit link. Debug. 
Run discord
Upload github
Win.

AWS
- Bot hosting - need this on if you want to get bot hosting/running
